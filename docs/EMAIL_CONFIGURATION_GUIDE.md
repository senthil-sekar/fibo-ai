# Gmail Integration — Configuration Guide

Step-by-step setup of the Google OAuth client behind Fibo's Gmail sync, plus how the flow
works. For the short version see [ENABLING_EMAIL_FEATURES.md](ENABLING_EMAIL_FEATURES.md).

## Google Cloud setup

### 1. Project and API

1. [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/) → **Select a project → New project**
   (e.g. `fibo`).
2. **APIs & Services → Library** → **Gmail API** → **Enable**.
   Also enable **Google Drive API** if you plan to use the Drive tab.

### 2. OAuth consent screen

1. **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen** → **External** → Create.
2. App name, support email, developer email. No logo needed while unverified.
3. **Scopes** — add:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
   - `openid`
   These are exactly what `EmailService.gmailScope` requests. Read-only: Fibo never sends,
   deletes, or modifies mail.
4. **Test users** → add every Google account that will connect. While the app is in *Testing*, only
   these accounts can authorize it, and refresh tokens expire after 7 days.

### 3. iOS OAuth client

**Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID → Application type: iOS**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Fibo iOS |
| Bundle ID | `com.fibo.app` |

Google returns a client ID of the form `<NUMBER>-<HASH>.apps.googleusercontent.com`. iOS clients
have **no client secret** — the app uses PKCE instead, which is why nothing secret is checked into
the repo.

## App configuration

### Client ID

One value, one place:

```bash
cp Config.local.xcconfig.example Config.local.xcconfig
```

```
# Config.local.xcconfig (git-ignored)
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID_PREFIX = <NUMBER>-<HASH>
```

`Config.xcconfig` derives `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` from that prefix and includes the local file if
present. Both are wired into the target as its base configuration, so:

- `Fibo/Info.plist` → `GoogleOAuthClientID` = `$(GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID)`, plus the URL scheme
  `com.googleusercontent.apps.$(GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID_PREFIX)`.
- `Configuration.GoogleOAuth` reads that key at runtime and exposes `clientID`, `reversedClientID`,
  `appRedirectURI` (Gmail: `com.fibo.app:/oauth2redirect`) and `driveRedirectURI`
  (Drive: `com.googleusercontent.apps.<NUMBER>-<HASH>:/oauth2redirect`).
- `EmailService` and `DriveService` consume those — no client IDs in Swift.

Leave the prefix unset and `clientID` is empty: `isConfigured()` returns false and the connect
buttons stay disabled instead of failing mid-flow.

### Scopes

`EmailService.gmailScope` requests `gmail.readonly`, `userinfo.email`, and `openid`;
`DriveService.scope` requests `drive.readonly`.

## How the flow works

1. **PKCE pair** — `EmailService.generatePKCEPair()` makes a 128-char verifier and its SHA-256
   challenge.
2. **Authorize** — `ASWebAuthenticationSession` opens Google's consent page with the challenge; the
   user approves; Google calls back on the custom scheme with an auth code.
3. **Token exchange** — code + verifier → `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`, returning access,
   refresh, and ID tokens.
4. **Identity** — the account email is read from the ID token (falling back to the userinfo
   endpoint).
5. **Storage** — tokens go to the iOS Keychain via `EmailAccount.saveTokens`; the account record
   goes to SwiftData. `refreshAccessToken` renews expired access tokens automatically.
6. **Sync** — `syncEmails` pulls message IDs, fetches details, parses the MIME payload, strips HTML,
   and stores `EmailMessage` rows; messages deleted in Gmail are removed locally and from the
   vector DB.
7. **Indexing** — each message is embedded on-device (`EmbeddingService`, `NLEmbedding`) and
   upserted into `LocalVectorStore` via `VectorDBService`, with metadata (`from`, `subject`,
   `thread_id`, `labels`, `date`). No backend involved — this happens entirely on the phone.
8. **Retrieval** — chat queries embed on-device and run a cosine-similarity search across the
   whole `LocalVectorStore` (no type filter); embedding similarity is what surfaces email
   content for mail-related questions.

## Reference

| Setting | Where |
|---------|-------|
| Client ID | `Config.local.xcconfig` → Info.plist → `Configuration.GoogleOAuth.clientID` |
| Redirect URIs | `Configuration.GoogleOAuth.appRedirectURI` / `.driveRedirectURI` |
| URL schemes | `Fibo/Info.plist` → `CFBundleURLTypes` |
| Scopes | `EmailService.gmailScope`, `DriveService.scope` |
| Sync interval | `EmailService.autoSyncInterval` (5 minutes) |
| Messages per sync | `syncEmails(for:limit:)`, default 50 |
| Indexing | On-device: `VectorDBService.upsert` → `LocalVectorStore` (no backend) |

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Connect button disabled | `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID_PREFIX` unset — `Config.local.xcconfig` missing or not picked up (clean build folder after creating it) |
| `redirect_uri_mismatch` | The client is not an iOS client, or its bundle ID isn't `com.fibo.app` |
| Browser opens, never returns | Redirect scheme missing from `CFBundleURLTypes` |
| `invalid_client` | Client ID typo, or the client was deleted in the Console |
| `access_denied` / "app not verified" | Account missing from the consent screen's **Test users** |
| `insufficientPermissions` on sync | Gmail API not enabled, or the scope was declined |
| Auth stops working after a week | Testing-mode refresh tokens expire after 7 days — reconnect, or publish the consent screen |
| Emails sync but Chat can't see them | Run **Settings → Sync All Now** to (re-)index; there's no backend to be "down" |

## Privacy

Read-only scope; tokens live in the Keychain; message bodies and embeddings live entirely on your
device, in `LocalVectorStore` — there is no backend and nothing is sent anywhere except the
Google OAuth/Gmail calls themselves. Disconnecting an account deletes its Keychain tokens but
leaves already indexed messages in SwiftData and in `LocalVectorStore` — use **Clear all emails
and resync**, or **Settings → Clear AI Data**, to purge those.
